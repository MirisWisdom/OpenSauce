How-To:
* Build the project, then put the XEX on your console
* In the same directly as your XEX, create a folder called "input", and put any encrypted ERA files in it
* Launch the XEX
* You can tell when it's done when you finally see a triangle spinning around on your screen
* Decrypted ERA files will now be in the "output" folder (if all was successful)
* Details of how everything went can be found in DefaultLog.txt


Notes:
* Encryption isn't currently working, but no big deal to me right now
* File format documentation isn't finished, nor up to date (most of it was ported from a .NET project not part of OpenSauce)
