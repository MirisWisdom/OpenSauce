This folder contains the source code to the TinyXml++ library. Kornner Studios did not make nor contribute to this code base in anway.

The ONLY modifications done to these source files was to #include statements so that they use the TinyXml folder path.

Due to their direct use in OpenSauce they also had to have the Precompile.hpp header included in all .CPP files.

The header files were also renamed to sport ".hpp" extensions instead of just ".h".
