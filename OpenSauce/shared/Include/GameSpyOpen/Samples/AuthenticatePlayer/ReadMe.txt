**GameSpyProfileAuthentication**

Summary: This sample authenticates a GameSpy profile via the AuthService (webservices) SDK, using the profile's uniquenick and password. This is a prerequisite for using many of the SDKs such as Sake and ATLAS. You can run the Release configuration to avoid debug output and hence make it easier to follow along.

If he doesn't already have one, the user will need to first create a GameSpy profile. You can either manage creation via the GP SDK or link the user to gamespyid.com. This is the same account used by IGN, Direct2Drive, FilePlanet, and many, many games that are Powered by GameSpy.

*Note: These samples are very simple implementations intended to be used as a basic reference to help you learn and implement the SDKs. As such they are not cross-platform and don't have Unicode configurations. For a more thorough conglomeration of cross-platform calls with Unicode support you can check out the test apps within each SDK directory.
