== System Requirements ==
These requirements are mainly guesswork as we do not have the resources for broad testing on multiple hardware configurations.

Operating System: Microsoft Windows XP SP3, Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Microsoft Windows 7 SP1
Computer/Processor: 1GHz processor.
DirectX: DirectX® 9.0c or later.
Memory: 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM.
Video card: 256 MB with shader model 2.a or 2.b, shader model 3.0 recommended.

You should not expect your current hardware to run Halo CE with OS at the same level of performace you had before. What OS adds does not come for free. If you feel that you would rather sacrifice some features for better performance, you can turn off various additions in the user settings file (see our Google code wiki for details).


== Overview ==
Thank you for installing OpenSauce for Halo Custom Edition! You now have access to a plethora of features and extensions added to Halo Custom Edition which you can read all about on our Google Code wiki:
	http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/wiki/

We have a WIP FAQ available for some of the more common questions that have been asked:
	http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/wiki/Doc_Halo1_FAQ

It is still early days for OpenSauce so the way ahead may have a few bumps for some, but we hope they are minimal and that you enjoy it all the same!

== Installation ==
If you have cut and pasted or have otherwise moved your Halo CE installation from it's original install location, you will not have the option to install the OS runtime. This is due to your registry entries for Halo CE having incorrect paths.

If you have problems with OpenSauce not running follow these steps first.

1. Install Halo Custom Edition using the official installer.
2. Update (or downgrade) Halo CE to version 1.09. We don't currently support 1.10 exes
3. Install OpenSauce for Halo CE.

== Having problems? ==
If you are having problems when running the game, such as an exception, a black screen or other game breaking issue please search our issues page on the OS Google code website to see if it has already been reported and if not, create a new issue to inform us of the problem. This is the ONLY bug reporting system we are using. We will not look at issues sent to us via forum posts, private messages, e-mails, etc. This is so that we can track the issues appropriately.
	ALL Issues	http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/issues/list?can=1 (includes issues that have been fixed/closed)
	Open Issues	http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce/issues/list

In the event of you having an exception, do NOT assume that you are having the same issue as somebody else unless you know what you are looking for in the exception details to determine whether it is an already reported issue. If in doubt, create a new issue and we will see if it is a duplicate and handle it accordingly.

When adding any issue to the database, add as much information as you can to help us debug the problem. For exceptions, please click the View Details button on the Send Report window that appears and copy the exception data into the issues description. That data will look something like this:

Problem Event Name: APPCRASH
Application Name: haloce.exe
Application Version: 1.0.9.620
Application Timestamp: 4ac7faf1
Fault Module Name: dinput8.dll
Fault Module Version: 3.0.0.0

Exception Code: c0000005
Exception Offset: 000126f6
OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.49

It is also useful for us to know your system specifications such as your graphics card, OS version, etc.

NOTE: The issues system is for problems and bugs ONLY. If you are unsure of how to use OS, please consult our wiki and/or create a post on Halomods to get community assistance. We are also NOT taking feature requests in any way.
