How does the Halo 2 Rendering pipeline work in BlamLib?

Steps:
1) Load rendered tag (could be structure bsp, render model, particle model, etc)
	A) Reconstruct tag for editor (some optimizations and extra steps added as opposed to to reconstructing a tag for single-file ("source") use)
	B) Load dependent material (shaders) tag
		[1] Load dependent bitmap tags
		[2] Add bitmaps to the bitmap manager which will construct the runtime pixel data we want from bitmap pixels
		[3] Tell the bitmap its place in the bitmap manager
	C) VertexBuffer reconstruction
	D) CreateForRender the rendered tag
2) Enter actual rendering pipeline
	A) Tell the rendered tag to render itself

3) Example: Render Model
	A) Pick level of detail
	B) Foreach region in render model, get 'base' permutation LOD section index
	C) Render section
		[1] Foreach part in section data, render the vertex buffers

4) Example: structure bsp
	A) Render Clusters
		[1] Render cluster section data
	B) Render Instance Geometries
		[1] Figure out the instance geometry definition and render its section data
