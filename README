OPENSAUCE
=========

This repository serves as a Git mirror to the original OpenSauce Release
repository, which is currently found here:

    https://bitbucket.org/KornnerStudios/opensauce-release

BRANCHES
--------

-   The master branch is used for active development. It is based on the
    original master branch from the aforementioned OpenSauce Release
    repository.

-   The upstream branch is a read-only copy of the OpenSauce Release
    repository's master branch.

-   Forks are stored in dedicated branches, all prefixed with "fork/".

-   When multiple forks were authored by the same person, they are grouped under "fork/<authorname>/"

-   Branches from the HaloMods repository are located under the "hm/"
    prefix.

-   The wiki branch was previously used to contain the OpenSauce
    documentation; however, the docs are now publicly located here:

    https://github.com/yumiris/OpenSauce/wiki
    

HALOMODS
--------

A sister-repo to the BitBucket repo.
This repository was developed parallel to the BitBucket repo and 
consequently has a similar, but different subversion history and set of branches.
Read-only copies of the branches in the original HaloMods repository are
located in the "hm/" namespace:

-   hm/Automated_Testing
-   hm/CheApe_Settings_(Mostly)
-   hm/Cleanup
-   hm/GBuffer_Rework
-   hm/OS_for_1.10
